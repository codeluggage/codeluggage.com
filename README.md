Official site for Imba. Work in progress.

## Run

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/imba/imba.io

# enter the folder
cd imba.io

# install dependencies
npm install

# build
npm run build

# package content from content/ (continously)
npm run watch

# run server
npm run dev
```

Because the site uses service workers it requires https: with a trusted certificate.
To test things in development you need to do it via Chrome launched with specific args:

```bash
open -na Google\ Chrome --args --ignore-certificate-errors --allow-insecure-localhost --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=https://localhost:9000
# if this does not work - try
# /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --allow-insecure-localhost --ignore-certificate-errors --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=https://localhost:9000
```

Now visit https://localhost:9000/ in that browser.

## Having trouble with https?

https is required to be able to run the examples and snippets. You can still run the rest of the site and work on documentation without this. So, if you're having trouble setting up https use the `npm start-without-https` command instead of the normal `npm start`, this will disable https while you work.
